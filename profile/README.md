# Woodside Labs
          
We are a technology company based in NYC that is focused on building
new types of messaging-based applications.

We are experts on messaging formats, having previously worked on
messaging infrastructure at [WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com) and [Modern
Treasury](https://moderntreasury.com).

Currently we're building [iso20022.js](https://iso20022js.com), an open-source
framework for communicating banks using open financial messaging standards.
Companies can use it to send SWIFT payments in less than 3 lines of code.

If you're building a company that creates payment messages, [let's chat](https://cal.com/woodside/30min).

Some of our other projects are listed [here](/projects).
